            "* **Missing Key Skills:**  While \"Python\" and \"AI/ML\" are present, the resume lacks explicit mention of crucial skills like \"chatbot development,\" \"knowledge base management,\" \"mobile application development,\" and specific AI/ML technologies relevant to the job description (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, specific cloud platforms).\n",
            "* **Weak Project Descriptions:** The GitHub project links are provided without context or descriptions.  The ATS can't interpret code; it needs clear explanations of the project's purpose, technologies used, and outcomes.\n",
            "* **Education Section Not Optimized:**  The education section simply lists degrees and GPAs without highlighting relevant coursework, projects, or academic achievements related to AI/ML.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Optimize Formatting:** Use a standard, clean resume format. Avoid emojis, fancy fonts, and unnecessary graphics. Use clear section headings (e.g., \"Summary,\" \"Skills,\" \"Experience,\" \"Education,\" \"Projects\").  Ensure consistent spacing and capitalization. Format contact information clearly at the top.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Target Keywords:** Incorporate specific keywords from the job description, such as \"chatbots,\" \"knowledge base,\" \"mobile application development,\"  \"full-stack,\" \"generative AI,\" and relevant AI/ML tools and technologies.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Quantify Achievements:**  Rewrite experience descriptions to showcase quantifiable achievements.  Use metrics and numbers to demonstrate the impact of your work (e.g., \"Reduced chatbot response time by 20%,\" \"Increased knowledge base accuracy by 10%\").\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Detail Projects:** Provide concise descriptions for each GitHub project, highlighting the technologies used, the project's purpose, and the results achieved.  Relate projects to the job description whenever possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Enhance Education Section:** Mention relevant coursework, projects, or academic achievements related to AI/ML.  If your GPA is high, include it, but focus on showcasing skills and knowledge relevant to the job.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Tailor to the Job:** Remove or minimize irrelevant experience, like the \"Campus Ambassador\" role. Focus on highlighting experiences and skills directly relevant to the target job.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Use a Skills Section:** Create a dedicated \"Skills\" section listing all relevant technical skills, tools, and technologies.  Consider using a combination of keywords from the job description and related skills.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Strong Summary:**  Write a concise and compelling summary that highlights your most relevant skills and experience for the chatbot developer role.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "By implementing these improvements, you can significantly increase your ATS score and improve your chances of getting your resume noticed by recruiters.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Skills Section:**  While it lists many skills, it lacks context and prioritization. Simply listing keywords isn't impactful. It doesn't tell the recruiter *how well* you know these skills or how you've *applied* them.  The \"Areas of Expertise\" feels redundant with the other skill lists.\n",
            "* **Work Experience:**  Descriptions are too generic and lack quantifiable achievements. They don't showcase the impact of your work. The overlapping dates for the DAPS and Coding Samurai internships are problematic and need clarification.  The tasks listed are often vague (e.g., \"Collaborated with back-end developers\"). How did you collaborate? What was the outcome?\n",
            "* **Education:**  Listing high school information is unnecessary since you're pursuing a BTech. CGPA is helpful, but mentioning your rank or any academic awards would be stronger. Expected graduation date should be prominently displayed.\n",
            "* **Achievements/Projects:**  While linking to GitHub is good, the project titles are not compelling and some have typographical errors in the URLs (extra spaces).  There's no description of what these projects *do* or what you *learned* from them.  Simply listing platform profiles (LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks) without context isn't very valuable.\n",
            "* **Final Summary:**  This section is redundant and takes up valuable space.  A summary/objective statement isn't usually recommended for technical resumes, as your skills and experience should speak for themselves.  The language is also generic (e.g., \"passionate Python developer\").\n",
            "* **Formatting:** Inconsistent spacing and capitalization make the resume look unprofessional.  The URLs with embedded spaces need immediate correction. The overall structure could be more visually appealing.\n",

            "**Improvements:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Structure:**  Reverse chronological order for work experience is standard.  Consider moving Projects above Education, as your projects are likely more relevant to technical roles.\n",
            "* **Skills:**  Group skills into relevant categories (e.g., Programming Languages, Web Development, Data Science).  Instead of just listing skills, briefly mention a project or experience where you used them effectively.  Quantify your skills whenever possible (e.g., \"Proficient in Python, utilized in developing 3 web applications with Django\").\n",
            "* **Work Experience:**  Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to describe your accomplishments.  Quantify your contributions whenever possible.  For example, instead of \"Optimized website performance,\" say \"Improved website load time by 15% by implementing caching strategies.\" Address the overlapping internship dates – was one part-time?\n",
            "* **Projects:**  Provide concise and compelling descriptions for each project. Highlight the technologies used, the problem solved, and the outcome achieved. Fix the typos in the URLs.\n",
            "* **Education:**  Remove high school information. Emphasize your BTech and expected graduation date. Include relevant coursework, especially if it aligns with the target job.\n",
            "* **Formatting:** Use a consistent font and spacing.  Use bullet points effectively.  Ensure proper capitalization and grammar.  Consider using a professional resume template for a more polished look.\n",
